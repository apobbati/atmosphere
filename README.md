Lambda functions are cool. They relieve developers and/or ops from the burden of having to maintain VMs, compute instances, etc.

The problem is that AWS and Google do it in their own way. That is a major downside. What if we could invoke lambda functions that are short-lived across cloud providers and scheduled proximally close to the cloud capabilities they require, without having to deal with the messiness of maintaining cloud infrastructure?
